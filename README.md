# React Router v6 Overview

This project demonstrates the concepts and implementation of front-end routing in React applications using **React Router v6**. It is part of my coursework towards my certification with Codecademy as part of the **Front-End Engineer Career Path**.

## Concepts Covered

In this module, I learned the following key concepts to add front-end routing to React applications:

1. **Install and Add React Router to a React Application**
   - Added `react-router-dom` to the project to enable routing.

2. **Enable Routing**
   - Used `RouterProvider` and provided a router for the application to manage navigation.

3. **Create and Configure a Router**
   - Utilized `createBrowserRouter()` to create a router for the application.
   - Configured routes using `createRoutesFromElements()`.

4. **Static and Dynamic Routes**
   - Used the `Route` component to add both static and dynamic routes to the application.

5. **Link and NavLink Components**
   - Added navigation to the app using `Link` and `NavLink` components.

6. **Access URL Parameters**
   - Used React Routerâ€™s `useParams` hook to access the values of URL parameters dynamically.

7. **Nested Routes**
   - Created nested routes using `Route`, `Outlet`, and relative paths for better component composition.

8. **Declarative and Imperative Navigation**
   - Used `Navigate` to declaratively redirect users.
   - Leveraged the `useNavigate` hook to imperatively redirect users in response to user actions or events.

9. **Query Parameters Management**
   - Accessed and set the value of query parameters using the `useSearchParams` hook to manage state based on URL query strings.
